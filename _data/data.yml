    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a researcher with passion for tackling problems at the intersection of AI 
      and neuroscience. Currently, I am focussing on depression models in rodents,
      extending computer vision tools from the lab to distinguish between control and
      diseased conditions. I leverage my background in cellular communication, and software
      engineering to approach the neurobiology of depression and form an understanding
      of its aspects that impact affect.
      
# I am a multidisciplinary professional with a passion for translating 
# innovative research into impactful solutions. With expertise in 
# computational neuroscience, machine learning, Python, 
# cellular communication networks, and operations management, 
# I thrive at the intersection of technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship. 
# My background includes diverse roles in both academia and industry, 
# coupled with hands-on experience in startup mentorship and networking.
